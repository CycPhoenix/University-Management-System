# University Management System (UMS)

Welcome to the **University Management System (UMS)** repository! This project is a Python application designed to manage university operations for roles such as administrators, lecturers, students, registrars, and accountants. Initially built as a command-line application, the UMS is structured to allow for future GUI enhancements, enabling a more interactive and user-friendly interface.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

- **Lecturer**: Records grades, views enrolled students, and tracks attendance.
- **Student**: Enrolls in courses, view grades, and checks attendance.
- **Registrar**: Registers new students, updates records, and issue transcripts.
- **Accountant**: Tracks tuition payments and generates fee receipts.

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Role-Specific Menus**: Each roles has unique functionalities accessible through a menu system.
- **File-Based Data Management**: Data is stored in text files, making it easy to update, view and manage information without complex databases.
- **Modular Functions**: Functions are modular, allowing smooth addition of new features and easy adaptation for future GUI implementation.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures correct data entries to maintain data integrity.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-management-system.git
   cd university-management system
   ```

2. Run the main program:
   ``` bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ðŸŽ® Usage
